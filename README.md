# PyCitySchools Analysis
Utilizing a csv. file in Jupyter Notebook to analyze standardized testing data---
## Overview
In this analysis I was asked by Maria to assist with analyzing data from a variety of sources to track standardized testing information for reading and math, to recognize trends and patterns. Unlike previous uses of excel and Visual Studio Code, analyzing a csv. file in Jupyter appears to be both more dynaic in its function, but in some cases Jupytiper is considered to be a more secure database for this type of work. I was able to produce a series of functions and charts to reflect trends and budgets of schools, as well as cleaned up some data in the process. ---
## Results
Unfortunately I ran out of time on this analysis, so I will have to update this and the Summary portion once reviewed.
