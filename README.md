# PyCitySchools Analysis
Utilizing a csv. file in Jupyter Notebook to analyze standardized testing data---
## Overview
In this analysis I was asked by Maria to assist with analyzing data from a variety of sources to track standardized testing information for reading and math, to recognize trends and patterns. Unlike previous uses of excel and Visual Studio Code, analyzing a csv. file in Jupyter appears to be both more dynamic in its function, but in some cases Jupytper is considered to be a more secure database for this type of work. I was able to produce a series of functions and charts to reflect trends and budgets of schools, as well as cleaned up some data in the process. ---
## Results
How is the district summary affected?
Within the district summary, there are small changes to the testing percentages. After cleaning up the data, the we see that % math passing, % reading passing, and % overall passing changed from 74.980853,	85.805463,	65.172326 to 74.8,	85.7,	64.9 respectively.

## How is the school summary affected?
Cleaning up the district analysis, removed null data from the table and changed the results of Thomas High Schools test scores within the district.

## How does replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores affect Thomas High School's performance relative to the other schools?
- Had to get a new laptop due to failed hard drive, will have to submit again once I can finish reviewing.
